# Splittor
This code solves the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations using the PISO algorithm.

The code uses a finite difference scheme.
The Eigen3 library is used for linear algebra support. 

# Lid Driven Cavity Benchmark

The following velocity profiles were generated by running pseudo-transients.
The results show good agreement with the high Reynolds number data generated Ghia, Ghia, & Shin.

## Limitations
Since this is run as a pseudo transient, high Reynolds numbers (1000 or higher) result in the solution diverging.
A "simple" fix to this is could be to ramp up the enforced velocity values over time, but I've chosen not to that for reasons unknown to myself. 

The code can also be slow, since each function call (re)creates its own coefficient matrix.
This could (and should) be made faster by initializing the coefficients at the start, then passing around references to them throughout execution.

# Future Work
As hinted at in the previous section, directly solving for the steady solution via an algorithm like SIMPLE is better than running a pseudo-transient.
I intend to work on a different code in the future, using finite volume method, collocated grid with Rhie-Chow interpolation, and the SIMPLE algorithm.
It is unlikely that forther work will be done on this code.
